# Machine Learning Project 2 – Multilayer Perceptrons

Course: DASC 41103 – Machine Learning  
Members: Coy Morris, Hunter Hill

## Project Overview

This project, completed for DASC 41103: Machine Learning, focuses on the design, training, and evaluation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier implemented in Python. The objective is to demonstrate practical understanding of deep learning principles by building and optimizing an MLP model using a real-world dataset, while clearly communicating methodological decisions and results.
